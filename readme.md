Then reference it in your controller or service etc;

    public function check() {

        $overlap = YourModel::overlapsWith('2016-01-01 15:32:00', '2016-01-01 16:46:00')->exists();

        $after = YourModel::after('2016-01-01 10:00:00', 2016-01-01 11:00:00', 'start', 'end')->exists();

        ...
